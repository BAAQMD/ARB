# Abbreviations should match what's in `BAAQMD_COUNTY_CODES` or
# `DST_COUNTY_CODES`.
#
# Note that Santa Clara is "SNC", not "SCL" or "SC". This is a
# convention inherited from Amir Fanai, who preferred the
# abbreviations to sort in the same lexical order as the full
# county names. (That is, "SNC" should come after "SM" and
# before "SOL", just as "Santa Clara" comes after "San Mateo"
# and before "Solano".)
